# Frontpage Photo
*HKI Framework 3.0.2 or higher required

![Homekit Infused](../images/frontpage-photo.png)

### Description
This is the default HKI frontpage person tracker, it is used on the frontpage (but can be used anywhere ofcourse)

### Configuration
For this card to work properly you must setup a waze sensor to do that you must create zones first (this can be done through the UI by clicking on the map in the sidebar, else read instructions here https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zone/)
Once you've set this up we can add a waze sensor, example below:
```
sensor:
  - platform: waze_travel_time
    name: Travel Time to Home Jimmy
    origin: person.jimmy
    destination: zone.home
    region: EU

  - platform: waze_travel_time
    name: Travel Time to Work Jimmy
    origin: person.jimmy
    destination: zone.work
    region: EU
```

### Advanced
| Parameters | Type | Default | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| person | String | none | Sets the person entity for this card |
| image_path | String | none | Sets the location of the image used on this card |
| navigation_path | String | none | You can choose between: `person_1, person_2, person_3 and person_4`, there are only 4 dedicated views for persons, to rename the person view header text you will need to edit the `/user/config/header_config.yaml` file! |
| alignment | String | left | Sets the alignment of the text and icons, choose from left or right (my advice would be to use left for the left photo and right for the right photo (if you use more than one) |
| text_color | String | white | Sets the text color within the card |
| phone_battery_sensor | String | none | Enter the phone battery sensor of this person (this is required!) |
| travel_time_to_home | String | none | Enter the sensor that shows you the travel time to home (this is required!) |
| travel_time_to_work | String | none | Enter the sensor that shows you the travel time to work (this is required!) |
